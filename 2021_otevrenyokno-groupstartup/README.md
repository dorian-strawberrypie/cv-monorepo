## Problem
In the second wave of covid, citizens found it hard to find an open place for a refreshment (all places were forced closed, except for takeaway). You couldn't tell whether a place has takeaway and if, what do they sell. 

## My idea
A platform with a map of all takeaway places, functionality to order and pickup etc.

## Team
The project was at first for a Project management subject. After that, however, we decided to try implementing it.

## Conclusion
In the process of writing up a marketing analysis, and after meetups with prominent gastronomy faces, like Lubos Kastner, we decided, that our competition has too much of a headstart rising the project risks too high.
