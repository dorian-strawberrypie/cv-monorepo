Unity game attempt, created by me and a few willing graphics student friends.

Description (copied from now non-existent store listing):

Fameulous! is an arcade game where a player chooses character of their liking and collects "Fame" points in minigames. The arcades bring a classic, nostalgic feel and some new elements to it.
Right now you can choose to play as Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga or Billie Eilish

First released game from 18 years old indie developer ;)
